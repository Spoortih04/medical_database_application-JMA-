The provided code is an Android application for managing user, doctor, and patient data using an SQLite database. It includes activities for user registration (MainActivity),
login (LoginActivity), and navigation (HomeActivity) between managing doctor and patient records. The DBHelper class is a singleton responsible for creating and managing database operations,
such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying records in the users, Doctor, and Patient tables. Input validation is implemented across activities to ensure data integrity, including checks for special 
characters, valid phone numbers, and secure passwords. The application allows users to manage records efficiently, providing a simple interface for healthcare management tasks.
